								<h5>The Project</h5>
								<p>Shopswell was an almost 2-year start-up on which I was a co-founder and the Director of UX and Design.</p>
								<h5>The Work</h5>
								<p>My work revolved around all UX & UI design for both the Web site and mobile applications, as well as any marketing collateral. Working along side the product, marketing, and dev teams, we followed an iterative design process, beginning with user scenarios, flow diagraming and wire-frame mockups, to flush out ideas before implementing and launching the complete designs.</p>
								<p>This was a small, nimble team and we were able to continuously improve upon the product by rapidly designing and rolling out features to test them with our users. With each batch of feedback we collected, we were able to quickly tweak, improve, and add new features to the product.</p>

								<p>The initial focus of the site gave users the tools to create lists and save products from any online retail shopping site. You could make lists of the kitchen tools you wanted, a vision board for your new living room, or even a list of recommended photography gear. If it was available at an online shopping site, you could add it to your list and anyone else could click through and potentially buy the same product. Additionally, users could follow each other to view each other's content.</p>
								<p>Based on our growth and the product design, we secured a seed-round of funding in Jan of 2016 to continue development.</p>
								<p>As users began to engage more, we added the ability to ask questions related to shopping. Questions about products, people seeking recommendations on what to buy to serve a particular need, birthday present ideas, the best cooking pans, ideas for home decor, and more.  The next new feature was the ability to post reviews of products you had experience with. Finally, we added a content publishing aspect for users to write and publish articles on the site about products and ideas they found and used.</p>
								<p>All of this content was displayed in each users feed, based on the other users and product categories they followed.</p>
								<p>By starting with a Web-first approach we were able to quickly improve and build upon the features we offered. Once we had everything working, in the Summer of 2016, we developed and launched <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shopswell/id1154682876?mt=8">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.shopswell.mobileapp">Android</a> app versions.</p>

								<h5>Results</h5>
								<p>Within a few months, we grew the site to have over 40,000 registered users, over 50K lists, +7k user created reviews and articles, and over 50k questions which generated north of 180,000 user answers.</p>
								<p>By Late summer 2016, traffic was up to 190,000 monthly active users, all engaging in questions, answers, articles, reviews and list-building.</p><p>Unfortunately the VC world can be a tricky place, especially when it comes to online shopping sites. In late Fall 2016, because we were not able to secure "A" round finding, we were forced to cease operations. We placed the site into 'sailboat mode' so many of the features are still available to the public.</p>

								<h5>The Project</h5>
								<p>TruMed Systems is the maker of an automated cold storage and dispensing machine for medical vaccines called Accuvax. I was contracted to design the UX and UI for the Web-based administrator and inventory management console for the Accuvax machine.</p>
								<p>*Some material cannot be discussed here due to proprietary information</p>
								<h5>The Challenge</h5>
								<p>This project required a design for one management console that served the needs of both the medical and office staffs, but also could be accessed by the larger medical group administration. Additionally there was a need for an administrative user management console.</p>
								<p>The portal needed to be extremely easy to use; for user management, real-time status of the kiosk, monitoring, access, and distribution of all vaccines, and administration and restocking of the inventory.</p>

							</div>
							<div class="col-sm-6">
								<div class="articleRight">
								<h5>The Process</h5>
								<p>The first step was understanding the ins-and-outs of the medicinal vaccine world. There are quite of few government regulations that have to be adhered to, from patient privacy to vaccine handling. To begin, I created personas for the different types of users of the console. administrator, clerical, clinician, physician, and technician.</p>
								<p>When I finished user types, I determined what they each needed to know immediately for a dashboard display of pertinent info and what functions they needed to perform using this tool. The main dashboard needed to display the current state of all machines on the system, stats such as up-time, temperature, inventory status, and any alerts.</p>
								<p>The functional tools included system user access—roles and profiles, vaccine management—data input, distribution, inventory levels, re-stocking information and lastly, patient information and vaccination orders from physicians.</p>

							</div>
							<div class="col-sm-6">
								<div class="articleRight">
								<p>Once this was complete, I established a navigational hierarchy for the console. It enabled users to quickly navigate to their respective areas.</p>
								<p>After the informational hierarchy, It was time to sketch some UI ideas. Once refined enough, I moved on to wireframe designs and user interactions. Those were then mocked up as full visual designs and prototyped which, after some refinements, got client approval before being approved and implemented.We went through a few iterative cycles based on feedback from users and stake-holders to refine some areas.</p>
								<h5>The Results</h5>
								<p>The system was deployed in 2016 and is currently being field tested at a number of medical facilities in the U.S.</p>
								<p>You need an account to access the full Accuvax system, but you can visit the <a href="http://trumedsystems.com/accuvax/">Accuvax Website</a> for some more info.</p>

								<h5>The Project</h5>
								<p>Cartshingle is a solution for Web developers to add a complete, custom shopping cart system to any site.</p>
								<!-- <h5>The Challenge</h5> -->
								<p>For this project I had to create a front-end Website design that serves as the marketing face of the product, as well as the backend account management tools for users to add and manage their custom shopping carts.</p>
								<p>The final piece was to design an easy-to-understand quick-start guide for users.</p>
								<h5>The Process</h5>
								<p>Understanding the product idea and the users was the first step, taking into account product inventory, shipping, reporting and billing tools.</p>
								<p>The two user types we targeted were, first, the developer who is building a basic eCommerce site for a client and second, the store owner who wants to build their own Website and not conform to a third-party tool that forces the inclusion of their branding.</p>
								<p>For these reasons, the site needed to be robust enough for a Web developer to use and presented in a clear, step-by-step fashion for the more novice user to follow.

								<p>I started out by deciding on a navigational and user work-flow hierarchy, with sketches and wire frames. The client is a Web development firm, so I had plenty of feedback and insight from the developer point of view on how they approached building the backend of an eComm site.</p>
								<p>We went through a few iterations, and quickly came up with and implemented a design we all were happy with.</p>
								<h5>The Results</h5>
								<p>The site is live and currently being used to create custom eCommerce Web stores.</p>

								<h5>The Project</h5>
								<p>Redesign an existing vacation home rental portal site. The previous site had not been updated in about 10 years and needed a refresh.</p>
								
								<h5>The Challenge</h5>
								<p>Update Website UI and improve usability. Increase inquiries and conversion rates. Create better user experience when looking for rental properties. Improve process of inquiring and booking properties.</p>
								<p>The previous site was more text-based and not very visual. The property images were smaller and many weren't high quality. My recommendations were to reduce the number of places for a user to click and focus on the areas that get them to the browsing of properties fastest. Minimize the prominence of links that the users did not frequent. I updated the design by making the photography of the properties the centerpiece of the site.</p>
								<p>Placing focus on visually featuring properties and increasing the sizes of images, they can almost sell themselves. In addition to the larger, more prominent images, I added iconography to each property page to represent the amenities available.</p>
								<p>The other new addition added was the ability to filter the properties by number of bedrooms, how many people they could accomodate and the nightly price rate.</p>
								<p>I also improved the gallery functionality for each property.</p>

								<h5>The Project</h5>
								<p>Goodsnitch was a mobile app and Web-app plugin that enabled businesses to get quick feedback on their product or service.</p>
								<p>Goodsnitch is now <a href="https://www.hundredxinc.com">HundredX Inc</a> and the app is called <a href="https://www.expresit.com">ExpresIt</a></p>
								<h5>The Work</h5>
								<p>While working with Goodsnitch, I was the primary designer. The myriad projects utilized every aspect of my design experience. I worked in print design, with one example being a 6'X6' wall advertisement that was on display at the San Diego Airport, multiple Website redesigns, mobile app UX and UI design, and Web app UX and UI design.</p>
								<h5>The Mobile App</h5>
								<p class="rightColImage"><img class="img-fluid" src="images/goodsnitch_phone.jpg" width="500" alt="responsive-image"/></p>
								<p>I first led a slight functional redesign of the app, and after a few months, and increased confidence from the CEO, I was able to lead a more complete redesign (pictured above) and rebranding, with the exception of a few elements that I was required to retain from the original. </p>
								<h5>The Business Dashboard</h5>
								<p class="rightColImage"><img class="img-fluid" src="images/goodsnitch_business_dashboard.jpg" width="500" alt="responsive-image"/></p>
								<p>One of the first projects was to create a business dashboard. This dashboard/Web app was available to our enterprise customers only. It enabled them to monitor, and interact with the feedback they received from their customers.</p>
